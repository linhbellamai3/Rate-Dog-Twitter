# Rate-Dog-Twitter
project to strengthen my skill in web scraping and data wrangling
I used Tweepy package in Python to collect information such as text, retweet counts, favorite counts, and type of media. I got other data from Udacity such as the tweets information, and dog types. I have to wrangle the data and clean the data from all three tables: two from Udacity and one I got for myself.
After that, I will combine the three tables to start my data analysis and visualization to see what are the factors that effects retweet counts and favorite counts.
